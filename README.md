# projeck-PM-ACCELERATOR
Data scince and Forecasting Project
Introduction
This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing data to extract valuable insights. The goal is to build robust forecasting models to predict future trends and create visually appealing dashboards to support data-driven decision-making. The project is designed to help individuals acquire data analysis and forecasting skills applicable to any domain.

Objectives
To clean and preprocess raw data for accurate analysis.
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
To develop forecasting models to predict key metrics (e.g., sales, growth rates).
To provide actionable insights through advanced analysis and visualizations.
To present findings in a clear, structured report or dashboard.
Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Date: The date of observation.
Country/Region: Geographical region of the data.
Confirmed: Number of confirmed cases.
Deaths: Number of deaths reported.
Recovered: Number of recovered cases.
Active: Number of active cases at a given time.
The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values, handle outliers, and ensure consistency for analysis.

Key Insights
Confirmed cases and active cases exhibit seasonality, making them predictable with time-series models.
Recovery rates vary significantly across regions, highlighting the importance of localized interventions.
Advanced models such as ARIMA and Prophet accurately predict trends with low error margins.
Visualizations effectively showcase trends, anomalies, and key drivers of changes in the data.
Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Prophet for data analysis and forecasting.
Power BI: For interactive dashboard creation.
GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
